- 👋 Hi, I’m @Joshua-The-Creator.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating unique, really epic FNF mods, or modifying existing ones to bring them up to date on the Kade Engine.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Haxe, Java, and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FNF mods -- programming wise. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE ASSETS (WITH THE XML FROM ADOBE FLASH OR GENERATED ELSEWHERE) I CAN *NOT* WORK WITH YOU
- 📫 You can reach me on Twitter by @vsCreatorFNF, or on Discord with @Joshua The Creator#3946
